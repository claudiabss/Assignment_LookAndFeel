        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="./img/aboutme.png">
        <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet, where facts, stories, and real-world knowledge come to life! I'm Claudia, a seasoned professional with more than 20 years of experience in IT and AI, and someone who has always been captivated by the power of non-fiction books.

            My professional journey has taken me through fascinating paths: working with global organizations like the World Bank, mentoring girls in tech, presenting at conferences, and leading projects in AI product management. While my career has been rooted in the fast-paced, ever-changing world of technology, my passion for non-fiction books has been a constant anchor.
            
            For as long as I can remember, I’ve turned to non-fiction books for inspiration, learning, and growth. Whether it’s exploring groundbreaking ideas in business, understanding the science behind human behavior, or diving into historical narratives that shape our present, I find joy in learning about the world through the lens of real stories and expert knowledge.
            
            I believe non-fiction books are a gateway to understanding the complexities of our world. They fuel curiosity, challenge assumptions, and often spark the kind of "aha" moments that can change how we think and act.
            
            This website is my way of sharing that love—whether you’re looking for recommendations, curious about new releases, or just want to connect with someone who appreciates the beauty of a well-researched idea.
            
            Let’s celebrate the books that inform, inspire, and empower us to grow. If you’re a fellow non-fiction enthusiast, you’re in the right place!.</p>
